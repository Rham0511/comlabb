### Partials (`partials/`)
Reusable template components used across multiple views.

## 🔧 Usage

### HTML Files
HTML files are served through `routes/index.js` using the `serveHtmlPage` function. The routing automatically determines the subfolder based on the page name prefix:
- `admin-*` → `views/admin/`
- `student-*` → `views/student/`
- `technician-*` → `views/technician/`

### Handlebars Templates
`.xian` files are rendered using the Handlebars engine through controllers (e.g., `authController.js`).

Example:
```javascript
res.render("login", { title: "Login" });
```

## 📝 Notes
- All static HTML files should be placed in their appropriate subdirectory
- Handlebars templates (`.xian`) remain in the root `views/` folder
- Partials are stored in `views/partials/` for reuse across templates
